<!-- # ROSCon 2024 Call for Proposals -->

ROSCon China 2024 is the chance for ROS developers of all levels, beginner to expert. We’re calling for your contributions! We’re looking for proposals for three different types of content:


- Talks: The standard presentation format is the talk, with the presenter(s) talking live about a specific topic, with a brief question period at the end, fitting into a 10, 20 or 30 minute time slot.
- Workshops: We will offer workshops. The goal of the workshops is to provide space for participatory/interactive experiences between the presenter(s) and the attendees and the chance to go more in depth into a subject than a regular talk could allow.


We are also planning keynote speakers and of course, lightning talks. The conference program will be a combination of single-track and double-track sessions.

Please note that, ROSCon China 2024 will be fully in-person, and remote presentations will not be considered. The official language is Chinese and but other language (such as English) is welcome.


## General Content Guidelines:

All topics related to ROS (1 & 2) are invited. Example topics include:

* New packages / frameworks
* Insights / improvements for existing packages
* Case studies on unique ROS deployments / use cases
* Developments for specific robots, sensors, platforms
* Competitions / collaborations / initiatives
* ROS in commercial / research / teaching environments
* Standards / best practices / development tools
* Novel applications combing ROS and LLM

To get an idea of the content and tone of ROSCon China 2024, check out the slides and videos from previous global ROSCon. If there is a topic on which you would like to present, please propose it. 

## Review Criteria

All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee to evaluate:

* Relevance to the ROS Community - The proposed content should use ROS in a substantial way, but beyond that, the work must also be relevant and compelling to a general ROS audience. Writing a ROS driver for a specific piece of hardware is an excellent contribution to the community, but describing the intricacies of its firmware may not be relevant to this audience. Furthermore, content should be relevant to a global and diverse community.
* Quality of Content/Impact - We encourage proposals to contain big ideas with high impact. Proposals should have a demonstrable quality as opposed to being purely theoretical.
* Quality of Presentation - Articulating your ideas clearly and grammatically is a key prerequisite for giving a compelling live presentation.
* Originality/Novelty - Content should be original and not something that has already been heard before. Will this be the 41st talk on a particular topic at ROSCon? Or are you presenting something new?
* Open Source Availability - Because we are an open-source community, proposals for which the underlying code and other content is available under an open source license have a greater chance of being accepted. It is not a hard requirement, but proposals focused on proprietary systems should contribute in some other way to the community. Promises of future release are difficult to evaluate, so having your content released at the time of proposal submission is preferred.

Additional consideration will be given to balancing the subject matter and duration of presentation.

We encourage proposals from presenters of all backgrounds and experience levels.
